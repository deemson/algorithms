# Algorithms #

## Summary ##

This repo contains code that implements algorithms in Kotlin for both
[Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and
[Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) Coursera courses.

There are several abstractions added to reduce code duplication and make it 
a bit more re-usable across different algorithms. There are also tests
added to check the implementations and show how the algorithms are used.

First data-structure explained in the course. The implementation is very 
close to that in the course.
