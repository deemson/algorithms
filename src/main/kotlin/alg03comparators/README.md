# Comparators #

Contains a bunch of utility comparators that are used with order-reliant
data-structures later in the course.

[MaxComparator](MaxComparator.kt) is used for a descending ordering.

[MinComparator](MinComparator.kt) is used for an ascending ordering.

[ReverseComparator](ReverseComparator.kt) reverses the ordering of another comparator.
